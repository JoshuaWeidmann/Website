        <div id="exfelons" style="display:none;"><br> How does a criminal record shape interactions with the State and society? 
          We present evidence from a nationwide field experiment, showing that prospective applicants with criminal records are about five percentage points less likely to receive information from 
          college admission offices. However, we demonstrate that bias does not extend to race. There is no difference in response rates to Black and White applicants. 
          We further show that bias is all but absent in public bureaucracies, as discrimination against formerly incarcerated applicants is driven by private schools. 
          Examining why bias is stronger for private colleges, we demonstrate that the private-public difference persists even after accounting for college selectivity, 
          socio-economic composition and school finances. Moving beyond the measurement of bias, we evaluate an intervention aimed at reducing discrimination: 
          whether an email from an advocate mitigates bias associated with a criminal record. However, we find no evidence that advocate endorsement decrease bureaucratic bias. </div>
